# Challenge 2 - The First App

## Background

Throughout the challenges, your team will build (and play) a rock-paper-scissors game. The app will consist of a bot for setting up rounds and tracking wins/losses, a configurable tab to hold a leaderboard, and a messaging extension to share your or your friend's game service record. The Microsoft Teams platform will host the game.

The first thing we will focus on is getting a bot running inside of Teams. This bot will be fairly basic and will only respond with hello to messages that have "hi" or "hello". The code for this bot is already written for you. This challenge is oriented around the process of running, packaging, and sideloading the bot into the team you created in the previous challenge.

## Challenge

Grab the code for the bot can be found in the challenges folder. It is called MicrosoftTeamsLearningApp.zip. It contains a Visual Studio solution file as well as a detailed README file that explains how to get the code running and sideloaded.

## Important Notes

It is suggested that one person in the group be the driver for coding while the rest of the group helps collaborate and look up references and documentation.

You should be able to perform the entire app manifest creation and sideloading flow from within the App Studio app.

## Success Criteria

- Your team in Microsoft Teams must have the App including the bot sideloaded.

- The bot must respond to "hi" and "hello" with "Hello!" from within the team.

- You should have a manifest created and stored in App Studio (or locally) for your application.
