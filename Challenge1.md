# Challenge 1 - Getting started with Microsoft Teams and Apps

## Background

Office 365 has seen dramatic growth in the enterprise. Office 365 now has 100M+ monthly active commercial users.

Microsoft Teams is the latest addition to Office 365, and it has been positioned as Microsoft's primary investment in cloud communications. Challenge 1 sets out to ensure you understand the very basics of Office 365 and Microsoft Teams. In the challenge, you will perform some basic operations such as forming a team, exploring the app gallery, and installing an app personally. If you are familiar with Microsoft Teams, this challenge should take no time and move your team to the "developer" tasks at the heart of OpenHack.

## Challenge

Each team member should sign in to Microsoft Teams with their Microsoft account. Next, provision one team for your group in Microsoft Teams (NOT one per team member). Make sure each person in your group is a member in the team you created.

If you are not familiar with Teams already, please take a few minutes to send each other messages (with giphys), create and delete channels, upload a team icon, and edit and delete sent messages.

Next, open the app gallery and take a look at the apps currently available as well as the relevant filters on the side. You will see that you can filter the apps down to various categories as well as break them up into the capabilities that they support.

In the search box, search for the app titled 'App Studio'. This app was built by our development team to help make app development easier. Each person should install this app personally and explore its features.

Find a fun "Team" app to install into your team from the app gallery. Some good suggestions are Karma and Polly. 

## Success Criteria

- As a group, you must provision one team in Microsoft Teams to collaborate in.

- You should have an understanding of how users interact with Teams.

- You should have an understanding of how users browse for and install apps in Microsoft Teams.

- You should have an understanding of what the App Studio app is and what features it has to help you build an app for Teams.

## Important Notes

- You should perform this challenge and all future challenges inside of the Microsoft tenant. Most if not all development features are enabled inside of the Microsoft tenant which means that you can install any Teams app and access various developer features such as sideloading (Keep in mind that most production tenants will lock down this functionality and often users will need a development tenant to test their apps).
